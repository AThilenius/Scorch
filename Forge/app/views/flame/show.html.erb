    <h3>What is Flame?</h3>
    <p>Scorch relies on a heavily modified Minecraft client and server. Flame is a custom resource-resolver and launcher for Minecraft, making setup turn-key. It is very important to note that <strong>this download of Flame is customized to you, <%= "#{sessionGetUser.firstName} #{sessionGetUser.lastName}" %>. Do not share it with anyone.</strong></p>
    <h3>Installing Java 6</h3>

    <strong>You must have Java 6 installed!</strong> Because of Minecraft requirements it must be exactly 1.6. Later versions of Java will not be supported and are almost guaranteed to cause crashes.
